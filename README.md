# Unofficial Auth0 client for Svelte-Kit

This repo is for anyone who loves using SvelteKit but suffers from lack of interoperatbility with existing tools and services. If you want to use auth0 with Universal Login and use SvelteKit with SSR, look no further.



This is a thin wrapper around the [auth0/nextjs-auth0 SDK](https://github.com/auth0/nextjs-auth0/), to adapt it to use with [Svelte-Kit](https://kit.svelte.dev/). This is a fork of an [existing repo](https://github.com/rmunn/sveltekit-auth0-unofficial) by [rmunn](https://github.com/rmunn) which has not had any updates in a while. 

## Installing

Run `pnpm add shawnlong636/sveltekit-auth0-unofficial` (or `npm add` or `yarn add`). You'll also need to use the Node adapter for Svelte-Kit. Edit your `svelte.config.js` and make it look something like this:

```
import node from '@sveltejs/adapter-node';
import preprocess from 'svelte-preprocess';

/** @type {import('@sveltejs/kit').Config} */
const config = {
  // Consult https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte-preprocess
  // for more information about preprocessors
  preprocess: preprocess(),

  kit: {
    // hydrate the <div id="svelte"> element in src/app.html
    target: '#svelte',

    // Node adapter
    adapter: node(),
  },
};

export default config;
```

## Usage

Once you've installed `sveltekit-auth0-unofficial`, start by setting up your Auth0 config. The recommended way to do this is to use environment variables; a complete list of environment variables available is at [https://auth0.github.io/nextjs-auth0/modules/config.html](https://auth0.github.io/nextjs-auth0/modules/config.html). Alternately, you could keep your config secrets in a file that you don't check in to git. For example, you could add `secrets.js` to your `.gitignore` file and then write something like this:

```ts
// src/lib/auth0.ts
import { initAuth0 } from 'sveltekit-auth0-unofficial';
import { AUTH0_SECRET } from './secrets';

// In addition to environment variables, can also put Auth0 settings here
const myAuth0Config = {
  // Required settings (must specify either here or in environment variables)
  secret: AUTH0_SECRET,  // Should be a randomly-generated string of at *least* 32 characters.
  // clientID: 'my_auth0_client_id',
  // clientSecret: AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET,
  // In this example, AUTH0_CLIENT_ID and AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET are passed in via environment variables and not specified here
  baseURL: 'http://localhost:3000',
  issuerBaseURL: 'https://example.us.auth0.com',

  // Optional settings
  enableTelemetry: false,  // Don't send Auth0 the library version and Node version you're running
  routes: {
    postLogoutRedirect: '/goodbye',
    // Can also specify login and callback routes here; default is /api/auth/login and /api/auth/callback
  }
}

// Environment variables and custom config will be merged in initAuth0, and its result should be your module's default export
export default initAuth0(myAuth0Config);
```

Then either follow the [quick-start instructions](#quick-start) below, or the [manual setup instructions](#manual-setup) further down.

### Quick-start

Simply create a file named `src/routes/api/auth/[auth0].ts` and use the `handleAuth()` function to handle authentication for you:

```ts
// src/routes/api/auth/[auth0].ts
import auth0 from '$lib/auth0';

export function get(req) {
  return auth0.handleAuth(req);
}
```

Note that the name of the route parameter `must` be "auth0". The `handleAuth()` function will automatically handle routes named `login`, `logout`, `callback`, and `me`. If you want to use other names for those routes, follow the manual setup instructions instead.

You'll also want to put the following into `src/hooks.ts`:

```ts
import type { Handle } from '@sveltejs/kit';
import auth0 from '$lib/auth0';

export const handle: Handle = async ({ request, resolve }) => {
  const auth0Session = auth0.getSession(request);
  request.locals.auth0Session = auth0Session;
  request.locals.isAuthenticated = !!auth0Session?.user;
  request.locals.user = auth0Session?.user || {};

  const response = await resolve(request);
  // You could modify the response here, e.g. by adding custom headers
  return response;
};

export function getSession(request) {
  const { isAuthenticated, user } = request.locals;
  return { isAuthenticated, user }
}
```

Now you'll have access to the `user` object and `isAuthenticated` boolean in the `export load({ session })` functions on your pages. Additionally, in your endpoint handlers you'll have access to `request.locals.auth0Session` which will contain `auth0Session.idToken`, `auth0Session.accessToken`, and so on. (See https://auth0.github.io/nextjs-auth0/classes/session_session.default.html for more).

You may want to read about the [helper functions available](#helper-functions) now.

### Manual setup

Instead of letting `handleAuth` define the routes for you, you can use individual functions for each route. For example, let's say you wanted your auth routes to be at the URLs `/login`, `/logout`, `/api/callback`, and `/api/me.json`. You'd first need to define those routes in your Auth0 config:

```ts
// src/lib/auth0.ts
import { initAuth0 } from '@auth0/nextjs-auth0';

const myAuth0Config = {
  routes: {
    // Must specify login and callback routes if they differ from the default
    login: '/login',
    callback: '/api/callback',
    // Don't need to specify logout and profile routes
  }
}

// Environment variables and custom config will be merged in initAuth0, and its result should be your module's default export
export default initAuth0(myAuth0Config);
```

And then you could write your routes as follows:

```ts
// src/routes/login.ts
import auth0 from '$lib/auth0';

export function get(req) {
  return auth0.handleLogin(req);
}
```

```ts
// src/routes/logout.ts
import auth0 from '$lib/auth0';

export function get(req) {
  return auth0.handleLogout(req);
}
```

```ts
// src/routes/api/callback.js
import auth0 from '$lib/auth0';

export function get(req) {
  return auth0.handleCallback(req);
}
```

```ts
// src/routes/api/me.json.js
import auth0 from '$lib/auth0';

export function get(req) {
  return auth0.handleProfile(req);
}
```

You'll also want to put the following into `src/hooks.ts`:

```ts
import type { Handle } from '@sveltejs/kit';
import auth0 from '$lib/auth0';

export const handle: Handle = async ({ request, resolve }) => {
  const auth0Session = auth0.getSession(request);
  request.locals.auth0Session = auth0Session;
  request.locals.isAuthenticated = !!auth0Session?.user;
  request.locals.user = auth0Session?.user || {};

  const response = await resolve(request);
  // You could modify the response here, e.g. by adding custom headers
  return response;
};

export function getSession(request) {
  const { isAuthenticated, user } = request.locals;
  return { isAuthenticated, user }
}
```

Now you'll have access to the `user` object and `isAuthenticated` boolean in the `export load({ session })` functions on your pages. Additionally, in your endpoint handlers you'll have access to `request.locals.auth0Session` which will contain `auth0Session.idToken`, `auth0Session.accessToken`, and so on. (See https://auth0.github.io/nextjs-auth0/classes/session_session.default.html for more).

The Auth0 functions from `nextjs-auth0` all take the same optional parameters documented in https://auth0.github.io/nextjs-auth0/. For example, to force a user profile refresh, call `auth0.handleProfile(req, { refetch: true });`. Or if you want to add custom data to the Auth0 session cookie, or remove data you don't want stored in the cookie, you can specify an `afterCallback` function in the callback handler, like so:

```ts
// src/routes/api/auth/callback.js
import auth0 from '$lib/auth0';

const afterCallback = (req, res, session, state) => {
  session.user.customProperty = 'foo';
  delete session.refreshToken;
  return session;
};

export function get(req) {
  return auth0.handleCallback(req, { afterCallback });
}
```

**NOTE:** The `req` and `res` objects your `afterCallback` function will receive are not real request and response objects. The https://auth0.github.io/nextjs-auth0/ documentation will list their type as NextApiRequest and NextApiResponse, but in fact they are minimal wrapper classes created by the `sveltekit-auth0-unofficial` library. These classes wrap around the request data that Svelte-Kit provides to your server-side route code, and simulate the NextApiRequest and NextApiResponse API just enough for `nextjs-auth0` to do its work. Do not be surprised if some basic functionality is missing from the `req` and `res` objects that your `afterCallback` function receives. This applies to all the callbacks you might pass to a `nextjs-auth0` function: the `req` and `res` objects your callback receives will have minimal functionality.

To return to a specific page after logging in, you can use a `returnTo` parameter.

```ts
// src/routes/login.js
import auth0 from '../auth0';

export function get(svelteReq) {
  const returnTo = svelteReq.query.get('returnTo');
  return auth0.handleLogin(svelteReq, { returnTo });
}
```

## Helper functions

The `nextjs-auth0` library defines two helper functions, `withPageAuthRequired` and `withApiAuthRequired`, for pages and API endpoints respectively. In `sveltekit-auth0-unofficial`, these functions have been converted to take arguments more appropriate for Svelte-Kit. The `withPageAuthRequired` function takes an optional parameters object, just as in `nextjs-auth0`, but where the `nextjs-auth0` version of this function allows you to pass in your own `getServerSideProps` function, the Svelte-Kit version of `withPageAuthRequired` will have you pass in your own `load` function instead. The return value of `withPageAuthRequired` is suitable for exporting as your page's `load` function. E.g.,

```html
<script context="module">
  export const load = auth0.withPageAuthRequired()
</script>
```

`withPageAuthRequired` will check whether the session contains a logged in user (detected by whether the session contains an `isAuthenticated` boolean that is true); if not, then it will redirect to your login page (as defined in your auth0 config) and return to the current page after the user has logged in. If the session contains a logged in user, then the value of `session.user` will be passed into `props.user`.

The optional `returnTo` parameter is not needed most of the time: `withPageAuthRequired` will calculate the return URL based on the current page's path and query parameters, which should be what you need most of the time. But if you need to return to a URL that's not exactly the one that the page was loaded by, then pass a `returnTo` parameter (as a string).

The optional `load` parameter (which replaces the `getServerSideProps` parameter from the `nextjs-auth0` library), if specified, should be a standard Svelte-Kit `load` function, which can be either synchronous or async. If there is no logged-in user, your `load` function will not be called, and `withPageAuthRequired` will redirect to the login URL. So your `load` function can count on there being a valid user in `session.user`. If your `load` function returns anything, then the props will be populated with a `user` value corresponding to `session.user`; but if your `load` function returns nothing (because you intend to fall through to a different route), then `withPageAuthRequired` will not populate the props and will also return nothing.

Usage example with inner `load` function:

```html
<script context="module">
  import { browser, dev } from '$app/env';
  import auth0 from '$lib/auth0';

  export const load = auth0.withPageAuthRequired({ load: async function load(params) {
    // Yes, this function doesn't need to be async, but I made it async for the example
    return { props: { innerLoadTest: "Yep, inner load got called" }};
    // No need to populate `props.user`, as `withPageAuthRequired` will take care of that part
  }});
</script>

<script lang="ts">
  export let innerLoadTest: string = "Nope, inner load was NOT called";
  export let user: any;
</script>

<svelte:head>
  <title>Profile</title>
</svelte:head>

<div class="content">
  <h1>Your profile</h1>

  <p>
    Hello, {user.given_name} {user.family_name}. <br/>
    Here's the profile picture you chose: <br/>
    <!-- svelte-ignore a11y-img-redundant-alt -->
    <img src={user.picture} alt='Profile image'>
  </p>

  <p>
    You can <a href="/api/auth/logout">log out</a> if you want.
  </p>

  <p>
    {innerLoadTest}
  </p>
</div>
```

The `withApiAuthRequired` function is simpler. It takes an endpoint handler (a `get`, `post`, etc. function) and wraps it in code that checks whether there's a valid login session. If there is already a valid session in `request.locals` (`request.locals.isAuthenticated` is true, and `request.locals.user` is a non-nullish value) then it will call your endpoint handler. If `request.locals` does not contain a valid session, it tries to construct one by calling the `getSession` function from `nextjs-auth0`, and if the Auth0 function returns a valid session, `withApiAuthRequired` will populate `request.locals` with `auth0Session`, `user` and `isAuthenticated` values. If there is no login session available, then `withApiAuthRequired` will return a 401 result containing the following JSON: `{ error: 'not_authenticated', description: 'The user does not have an active session or is not authenticated' }`.

The second parameter to `withApiAuthRequired`, if passed, should be an object with one of two keys:

- `unauthHandler`: a request handler that will be called instead of returning a 401 if there is no Auth0 login session (this could, for example, return a "basic" version of a resource, with the "full" version available only to logged-in users, or it could localize the JSON)
- `unauthJson`: the JSON to return in the body of the 401, instead of the default JSON above.

If both `unauthHandler` and `unauthJson` are specified, `unauthHandler` will be used and `unauthJson` will be ignored.
